### REPOSITORY FOR LEGACY PURPOUSE ONLY â€” NO LONGER MAINTAINED

## Description
App was developed in January 2019 for the purpose of the class project (back then I didn't know about the great prototyping tools like Adobe XD, so I just learned fundamentals of Anuglar in a week and then switched to Ionic 3 to build the prototype in the next one). It was connected with Firebase Console to send/receive notifications.

Please notice that UI design wasn't created with the UX in mind. The main goal of the project was the presentation of a concept which was solving one of the problems in the UG student's life. Thus the UI design wasn't the part of the final grade, so we didn't focus on that.

Original and still working (build in January 2019) APK is located in `./ps-prototype-apk.zip`
